                        <p class="py-6 text-xl">Car mechanics reveal the 20 automotive tools they couldn't live without, including a battery-powered impact wrench, an air ratchet, a bolt spinner and an automotive stethoscope.</p>

                        <p class="py-6 text-xl">Doing your own car repairs saves a boatload of money and gives you bragging rights on Monday morning. (Yeah, I replaced my crankshaft over the weekend-so what?) But let’s be honest here—you’re really in it for the tools, right? That’s what I thought, so I asked three shop owners, our auto mechanic field editors and my gearhead friends to tell you about their favourite tools. I’ve also added all the special tools I wish I’d had when I first started bustin’ bolts (and knuckles). Most are less than $100. And you can use them for non-automotive projects too. There, isn’t that all the justification you need to buy more tools?</p>
